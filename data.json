My wife Faith shared this photo a few days ago ahead of the party to shower our baby girl with love and asked for any name suggestions - we got a lot of beautiful responses & loved reading through them (some people were doing the most ðŸ˜„) as we are still deciding.  We are happy to be nearing the home stretch with our soon to be little scholar!"

In these photos I was dropping him off at MEPS for his final examination a couple of months ago and letâ€™s just say this process has been a journey but we got that call today! He did it! Now I have to process him leaving me soon ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜” but Iâ€™m so so so proud and excited for his approaching life experience."

One breath at a time! We must also be conscious of our bodies! And the way air flows through it! Taking a second to feel your breath go in and out of your body! The piece of mind you gain!"
